\begin{abstract}
	The European Artificial Intelligence Act proposes a regulatory framework for Artificial Intelligence Systems aiming at ensuring that such a systems placed on the EU market and used in the Union are safe and respect existing law on fundamental rights and Union values.
	Although proposing a compelling legal framework such an act falls short in terms of delivering technical requirements that can be implemented by the Decision Maker.
	Moreover, the Act does not adequately address the trade-offs that an Artificial Intelligence system may have in different aspects ranging from accuracy to transparency, robustness to fairness ans so forth.
	In this paper we propose an audit framework addressing these tensions. 
	The proposed approach collects technical requirements from state-of-the-art research combines them using the Analytical Hierarchical Approach and construct a Multicriteria Optimization problem allowing the decision maker to mitigate AI risks by optimally allocating his resources.
